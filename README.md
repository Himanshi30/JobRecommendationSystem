# Integrated Job Post Verification and Personalized Job Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to create a system that verifies the authenticity of job postings and provides personalized job recommendations. It uses a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and deep learning models to analyze job posting data and classify fraudulent job postings. The goal is to build a reliable job verification model and provide personalized recommendations to users based on job data.

## Features

- **Job Post Verification**: Classify job postings as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
- **Personalized Job Recommendations**: Recommend jobs to users based on their preferences and historical data.
- **Data Preprocessing & EDA**: Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Building**: Implement multiple machine learning and deep learning models for fraud detection, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Networks (MLP)
- **Text Preprocessing**: Use NLP techniques to clean and process job descriptions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model building.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text processing.
- **TensorFlow**: (Optional) For deep learning models if required.

### Key Columns:
- `title`: Job title.
- `location`: Job location.
- `department`: Job department.
- `employment_type`: Type of employment (e.g., Full-time, Part-time).
- `required_experience`: Required experience level.
- `required_education`: Required education level.
- `industry`: Industry the job belongs to.
- `fraudulent`: Target variable (1 if fraudulent, 0 if non-fraudulent).

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Data is collected from Kaggle and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Missing values are handled by filling NaN values with empty strings where necessary.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations are created to analyze the distribution of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent jobs.
- The relationships between categorical features (like `employment_type`, `required_experience`, etc.) and the target variable are explored.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are filled.
- Categorical features are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding and TF-IDF for textual features.
- Location information is extracted and cleaned to isolate the country.

### 4. Model Building
- Multiple machine learning models are trained:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Neural Networks (MLP)**
- Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.

### 5. Text Preprocessing
- Job descriptions are preprocessed using NLP techniques:
  - Tokenization.
  - Removal of stopwords and punctuation.
  - Lemmatization.
- TF-IDF is applied to the job description text to create features for model training.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- The models are evaluated using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- ROC curves are plotted to compare the performance of all models.

  ## Conclusion and Next Steps

The Integrated Job Post Verification and Personalized Job Recommendation System has been successfully developed and evaluated, providing a robust framework for verifying job post accuracy and offering personalized job recommendations. The system utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to ensure the integrity of job postings and deliver tailored recommendations based on user preferences and qualifications.

### Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Job Post Verification**: Improve the job post verification process by incorporating additional NLP models and data validation techniques to ensure higher accuracy.

2. **Refining Recommendation System**: Fine-tune the recommendation engine by exploring more sophisticated algorithms, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, to further personalize job suggestions.

3. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback on recommended jobs to continuously improve the recommendation engine and provide better job matches.

4. **Scalability and Performance**: Optimize the system for scalability to handle large-scale job postings and user interactions without compromising performance.

5. **Advanced Analytics and Reporting**: Develop features for generating advanced reports and analytics to provide insights into job market trends, user preferences, and system performance.

6. **Integration with External Platforms**: Integrate with external job boards and professional networks to expand the pool of job postings and user profiles, improving the accuracy of job recommendations.

7. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploy the final system as a web or mobile application accessible by users, and establish regular updates and maintenance schedules to keep the system running smoothly.
